# **Mediator Pattern**

## **Purpose**

Centralizes communication between objects to reduce direct dependencies among them. It facilitates interaction and maintenance of objects in a system.

## **Problem**

When many objects need to communicate with each other, their relationships can become complex, making the system difficult to maintain and scale.

## **Solution**

The Mediator pattern introduces an intermediary object (mediator) that manages interactions between objects. Objects do not communicate directly but through the mediator.

## **Pros**

- Decouples objects, improving flexibility and scalability.
- Simplifies maintenance by reducing complexity in direct relationships.
- Centralizes communication logic.

## **Cons**

- The mediator can become a bottleneck if it handles too many interactions.
- Adds an additional layer that may increase complexity in small systems.

## **Real-World Use Cases**

- **Chatrooms:** A mediator manages communication between different users, ensuring users do not interact directly.
- **Air traffic control systems:** A mediator coordinates communication between various airplanes and controllers.
- **Complex UI applications:** Where multiple components need to interact without depending directly on each other.

## **Relationships with Other Patterns**

- **Observer:** Mediator and Observer can work together, with the Mediator managing events and the Observer being notified of changes.
- **Command:** Mediator can invoke commands that encapsulate requests, centralizing execution logic.
