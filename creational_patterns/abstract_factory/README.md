# **Abstract Factory Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Defines an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **Problem**: When a system needs to create different types of objects but should not depend on their concrete classes, especially when the set of objects varies based on context.

- **Solution**: Use an **abstract factory** that provides a set of methods to create related objects. Each concrete implementation of the factory creates a specific family of objects.

## **Pros**

- Allows easy swapping of product families.
- Facilitates creating systems independent of product classes.
- Isolates object creation logic from the rest of the code.

## **Cons**

- Increases complexity by adding more classes.
- May be unnecessary if there is only one type of product.
- Not suitable when there are many unrelated product types.

## **Real-World Use Cases**

- **User Interfaces**: Creating different interfaces (e.g., one for Windows and another for macOS) with graphical components (buttons, windows, etc.) in distinct styles.
- **Games**: Creating different worlds or levels with specific enemies, weapons, and objects for each scenario.
- **Database Systems**: Providing different database implementations with a common interface.

## **Relations with Other Patterns**

- **Builder**: Both patterns are used to create complex objects, but **Abstract Factory** focuses on families of products, while **Builder** is used to construct a single object step by step.
- **Factory Method**: **Abstract Factory** extends **Factory Method** by allowing the creation of multiple families of objects, not just one type.
