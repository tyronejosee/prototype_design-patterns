# **Builder Pattern**

- **Purpose**: To separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the creation of different representations of the same type of object.

- **Problem**: Creating objects with multiple optional parameters or complex configurations can be difficult to manage in a single constructor.

- **Solution**: Use a "builder" object to construct the object step by step, separating the construction logic from the business logic.

## **Pros**

- Facilitates the creation of complex objects with multiple configurations.
- Improves the readability and maintainability of the code.
- Allows the creation of different types of objects from the same base class.

## **Cons**

- Can be overkill for simple objects with few attributes.
- Increases the number of classes to manage.
- Can be unnecessary if there are not many optional parameters.

## **Real Use Cases**

- **User Interface Development**: Building windows or forms with multiple configuration options.
- **Document or Report Generation**: Creating complex documents with different sections or configurations.

## **Relationships with Other Patterns**

- **Abstract Factory**: The Builder can be used in combination with Abstract Factory to create complex objects flexibly.
- **Factory Method**: Both patterns facilitate object creation, but Builder is more suitable for objects with many configurations.
