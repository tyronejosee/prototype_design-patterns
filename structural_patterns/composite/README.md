# **Composite**

## **Purpose**

Enable treating individual objects and composites (hierarchical structures) uniformly.

## **Problem**

Working with hierarchical structures (e.g., a tree of elements) is complex because the code must distinguish between simple and composite nodes when processing these elements.

## **Solution**

Define a common interface for all objects in the hierarchy. Composite objects delegate operations to their children, allowing uniform treatment of simple and composite objects.

## **Pros**

- Simplifies working with hierarchical object structures.
- New element types can be added without modifying existing code.
- Simple and composite components reuse the same logic.

## **Cons**

- The structure can be more complex to implement.
- May be unnecessary for simple structures, adding design overhead.

## **Real-World Use Cases**

1. **File Systems**: Treating files and folders uniformly.
2. **Application Menus**: Individual menu options or nested submenus.
3. **Graphics**: Drawing simple shapes (circles) or composites (groups of shapes).
4. **Organizational Systems**: Organizational charts with employees and teams.

## **Relationships with Other Patterns**

1. **Composite + Decorator**: Components can be extended with additional responsibilities.
2. **Composite + Visitor**: Facilitates adding new operations on the hierarchy without modifying it.
3. **Composite + Iterator**: Iterates over complex object hierarchies.
4. **Composite + Chain of Responsibility**: Allows composite objects to handle or delegate requests.
